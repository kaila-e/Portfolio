      <h3> About Kaila </h3>
        <p> In my years as a childcare professional, and previously as a store manager, I've learned a lot about patience and working with others. I had a pretty strong interest in software development when I was much younger, but decided to pursue other paths at the time, and now I've come full circle. In my spare time I enjoy roller skating, ice skating, reading, and cosmetics.</p>

        <p> As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/#mentorship">Thinkful</a>, I've started my path to becoming a software developer and couldn't more thrilled! </p>

        <p> If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I'm looking forward to working with other developers to build great software! </p>
